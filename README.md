Hey I'm Lucas! My scientific interest lies in the engineering aspects of earth science modeling. After studying air
pollution for over a decade, I now work at [IGE](https://www.ige-grenoble.fr/?lang=en) on the implementation of
atmosphere-icesheets interactions within a state-of-the art climate model, with the goal of improving sea level rise
predictions.
